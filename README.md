Introduction
------------

pimd is a lightweight, stand-alone PIM-SM/SSM multicast routing daemon
available under the free [3-clause BSD license][License].  This is the
restored original version from University of Southern California, by
Ahmed Helmy, Rusty Eddy and Pavlin Ivanov Radoslavov.

Today pimd is maintained at [GitHub][].  Use its facilities to access
the source, report bugs and feature requests, and send patches or pull
requests.  Official release tarballs at the [homepage][] and at the
GitHub proejct's release directory.

pimd is primarily developed on Linux and should work as-is out of the
box on all major distributions.  Other UNIX variants (OpenBSD, NetBSD,
and FreeBSD) should also work, but are not as thoroughly tested.  For
some tips and details, see the `configure` script.

For a summary of changes for each release, see the [ChangeLog][].


Build & Install
---------------

The configure script and Makefile supports de facto standard settings
and environment variables such as `--prefix=PATH` and `DESTDIR=` for the
install process.  E.g., to install pimd to `/usr` instead of the default
`/usr/local`, but redirect install to a package directory in `/tmp`:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
	make
    make DESTDIR=/tmp/pimd-2.3.2-1 install-strip


Building from GIT
-----------------

If you want to contribute, or simply just try out the latest but
unreleased features, then you need to know a few things about the
[GNU build system][buildsystem]:

- `configure.ac` and a per-directory `Makefile.am` are key files
- `configure` and `Makefile.in` are generated from `autogen.sh`
- `Makefile` is generated by `configure` script

To build from GIT you first need to clone the repository and run the
`autogen.sh` script.  This requires `automake` and `autoconf` to be
installed on your system.

    git clone https://github.com/troglobit/pimd.git
    cd pimd/
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure && make

GIT sources are a moving target and are not recommended for production
systems, unless you know what you are doing!


Configuration
-------------

The configuration is kept in the file `/etc/pimd.conf`, the order of
the statements are in some cases important.

PIM-SM is a designed to be a *protocol independent* multicast routing
protocol.  As such it relies on unicast protocols like, e.g, OSPF, RIP,
or static routing entries, to figure out the path to all multicast
capable neighboring routers.  This information is necessary in setups
with more than one route between a multicast sender and a receiver to
figure out which PIM router should be the active forwarder.

However, pimd currently cannot retrieve the unicast routing distance
(preference) and metric of routes from the system, not from the kernel
nor a route manager like zebra.  Hence, pimd currently needs to be setup
statically on each router using the desired distance and metric for each
active interface.  If either the distance and/or the metric is missing
in an interface configuration, the following two defaults will be used:

    default-route-distance   <1-255>     default: 101
    default-route-metric     <1-1024>    default: 1024

By default pimd starts up on all interfaces it can find, using the above
defaults.  To configure individual interfaces use:

    phyint <address | ifname> ...

You can reference the interface via either its local IPv4 address or
its name, e.g., eth0.  Some common interface settings are:

   * `disable`: Disable pimd on this interface, i.e., do not send or
     listen for PIM-SM traffic

   * `dr-priority <1-4294967294>`: The DR Priority option, sent in all
     all PIM Hello messages.  Used instead of the IP address in all DR
     elections, if all PIM routers in LAN advertise it.  The higher, the
     better, default 1.

   * `distance <1-255>`: The interface's admin distance value (also
     confusingly referred to as *metric preference* in the RFC) in PIM
     Assert messages.  Used with `metric` to elect the active multicast
     forwarding router.  Defaults to `default-route-distance`

   * `metric <1-1024>`: The cost for traversing this router.  Used with
     the `preference` value above. Defaults to `default-route-metric`

More interface settings are available, see the pimd(8) manual page for
the full details.

The most notable feature of PIM-SM is that multicast is distributed from
so called Rendezvous Points (RP).  Each RP handles distribution of one
or more multicast groups, pimd can be configured to advertise itself as
a candidate RP `rp-candidate`, and request to be static RP `rp-address`
for one or more multicast groups.

    rp-address <address> [<group>[/<LENGTH> | masklen <LENGTH]

The `rp-address` setting is the same as the Cisco `ip pim rp-address`
setting to configure static Rendezvous Points.  The first argument can
be an IPv4 address or a multicast group address.  The default group and
prefix length is 224.0.0.0/16.  Static RP's always have priority 1.

    rp-candidate [address | ifname] [interval <10-16383>] [priority <0-255>]

The Rendezvous Point candidate, or CRP, setting is the same as the Cisco
`ip pim rp-candidate` setting.  Use it to control which interface that
should be used in RP elections.

   * `address | ifname`: Optional local IPv4 address, or interface name
     to acquire address from.  The default is to use the highest active
     IP address.

   * `interval <10-16383>`: The CRP advertisement interval, in seconds.
     Default: 60 seconds

   * `priority <0-255>`: How important this CRP is compared to others.
     The lower the value here, the more important the CRP.  Like Cisco,
     pimd defaults to priority 0 when this is left out

In the CRP messages sent out by pimd, one or more multicast groups can
be advertised using the following syntax.

    group-prefix <group>[</LENGTH> | masklen <LENGTH>]

Each `group-prefix` setting defines one multicast group and an optional
mask length, which defaults to 16 if left out.  A maximum of 255
multicast group prefix records is possible for the CRP.

To keep track of all Rendezvous Points in a PIM-SM domain there exists a
feature called *Bootstrap Router*.  The elected BSR in a PIM-SM domain
periodically announces the RP set in Bootstrap messages.  For details on
PIM BSR operation, see [RFC 5059](http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc5059).

    bsr-candidate [address | ifname] [priority <0-255>] [interval <10-26214>]

The configuration of a Candidate BootStrap Router (CBSR) is very similar
to that of CRP.  If either the address or the interface name is left out
`pimd` uses the highest active IP address.  If the priority is left out,
`pimd` (like Cisco) defaults to priority 0.  If the interval is left out,
it defaults to the RFC value of 60 seconds.

To *disable CRP and CBSR* completely in `pimd`, simply comment the two
lines out from your `pimd.conf`, and make sure `pimd` can find the file.
Because if `pimd` cannot find the file it will default to them enabled,
with defaults listed in the `pimd.conf` included in the distribution.

In a PIM-SM domain there can be two, or more, paths from a designated
router (DR) for a multicast sender to reach a receiver.  When receivers
begin joining multicast groups all data is received via the *shared
tree* (RPT) from each Rendezvous Point (RP).  This is often not an
optimal route, so when the volume starts exceeding a configurable
threshold, on either the last-hop router or the RP itself, the router
will attempt to switch to the *shortest path tree* (SPT) from the
multicast source to the receiver.

In versions of pimd prior to 2.2.0 this threshold was confusingly split
in two different settings, one for the DR and one for the RP.  These
settings are still supported, for compatibility reasons and documented
in the man-page, but it is strongly recommended to change to the new
syntax instead:

    spt-threshold [rate <KBPS> | packets <NUM> | infinity] [interval <5-60>]

Only slightly different from the Cisco `ip pim spt-threshold` setting,
pimd can trigger a switch to SPT on a rate or number of packets and you
can also tweak the poll interval.  It's recommended to keep the interval
in the tens of seconds, the default is 100 sec.  The default threshold
is set to zero packets, which will cause a switch over to the SPT after
the first multicast packet is received.


Example
-------

    # Interface eth0 is disabled, i.e., pimd will not run there.
    phyint eth0 disable

    # On this LAN we have a lower numeric IP than other PIM routers
    # but we want to take care of forwarding all PIM messages.
    phyint eth1 dr-priority 10

    # Partake in BSR elections on eth1
    bsr-candidate eth1

    # Offer to be an RP for all of 224.0.0.0/4
    rp-candidate eth1
    group-prefix 224.0.0.0 masklen 4

    # This is the built-in defaults, switch to SPT on first packet
    spt-threshold packets 0 interval 100


Starting
--------

Having set up the configuration file, you are ready to run `pimd`.  As
usual, it is recommended that you start it manually first, to make sure
everything works as expected, before adding it to your system's startup
scripts, with any startup flags it might need.

```
    pimd [-n] [-s] [-c file] [-d subsys1[,...,subsysN]] [-l level]
```

* `-n`: Run in foreground, with logs defaulting to stdout
* `-s`: Use syslog, default unless `-n`
* `-c file`: Utilize the specified configuration file rather than the
   default, `/etc/pimd.conf`
* `-d [subsys1,...,subsysN]`: Subsystems to enable debug for when
  running the daemon.  Optional argument, if left out, all subsystems
  are enabled.  Type `pimd -h` for a full list of subsystems
* `-l level`: Log level, one of `none`, `error`, `warning`, `notice`,
   `info`, or `debug`.  Default is `notice`

**Example:**

```
    pimd -c /cfg/pimd.conf -digmp_proto,pim_jp,kernel,pim_register
```

Note, spaces cannot be used in the argument to `-d`.  A slightly more
readable variant is the long option `--debug`:

```
    pimd --debug=igmp_proto,pim_jp,kernel,pim_register
```

Monitoring
----------

To see the virtual interface table, including neighboring PIM routers,
and the multicast routing table:

    pimctl

or to watch it continually:

    watch pimctl

See the  `pimctl help` usage text  for more details.  Also,  `pimd` logs
important events to  the system log file, in particular  at startup when
it parses the `pimd.conf` configuration file.


Large Setups
------------

pimd is limited to the number of `MAXVIFS` interfaces listed in the
kernel headers.  In Linux see `/usr/include/linux/mroute.h`. 

To overcome this limitation, adjust the kernel `#define` to, e.g.,
1280, and configure pimd `--with-max-vifs=1280`.

With this many interfaces the kernel may run out of memory to let pimd
to enable IGMP on all interfaces.  In Linux, use sysctl to tweak the
following settings:

    sysctl -w net.core.optmem_max=327680
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.igmp_max_memberships=5120
