Abstract

This document specifies version 1+ Auto-RP. Compared with version 1
this version has the ability to deny RP-mappings by advertising negative
group prefixes.

1. Introduction


PIM-SM (Protocol Independent Multicast, Sparse Mode) [PIM-SM] relies
on shared data distribution trees to jump start multicast
communication.  A shared data distribution tree is rooted at a router
called the rendezvous point (RP) where the multicast sources and
receivers 'meet'.  Although it is possible to use one single router as
the RP for all groups, using different RPs for different groups has a
number of advantages: it allows load-splitting among different RPs;
the formation of the shared tree can take advantage of the known group
membership distribution characteristics; and it provides a means to do
comparative diagnostics among different RP rooted trees under
exceptional conditions.

We propose a mechanism that allows the mapping (group prefix, RP
address) to be configured only in the RP routers and to be discovered
by all designated routers automatically. This mechanism guarantees
consistency and is robust. It will be able to co-exist seemlessly
with other means of group-RP mapping dissemination methods.

2. Design Goals

   a) Any router should be allowed to announce its willingness to act as
      an RP for any range of group addresses;

   b) The designated routers do not need to resolve conflicts if different
      routers announced conflicting ranges of group addresses;

   c) The mechanism should be simple, and can use existing mechanisms,
      either dense or sparse mode forwarding logic.

   d) The mechanism should have minimal impact on the non-upgraded routers;

   e) Has no single point of failures, and is resilent to packet losses;

   f) It should work seemlessly with other group-RP mapping methods,
      including statically configurations, across different versions of
      PIM implementation. Therefore, it should not require any changes
      to the existing protocols.

3. The Mechanism

3.1 Announcing the group-RP mappings

  Each RP, once configured to announce the range of group addresses it
intends to serve, will periodically send G-RP mapping announcement
packets to the well-known RP announcement group address CISCO-RP-ANNOUNCE.
For now, the period for sending this announcement is set to 60 seconds.
When the number of RP's grows large, it is possible to let the RPs listen
to the group CISCO-RP-ANNOUNCE and use a dynamic backoff algorithm similar
to that used in sd[2] to reduce the traffic consumed by the announcement
packets. However, we do not foresee in the near future any need for
concerns about the bandwidth consumptions by the announcement traffic,
since the number of RPs within a domain will most likely be quite small
(due to administrative constraints).

3.2 The RP-mapping Agent

One or more specially configured routers, called "RP-mapping agents", listen
on CISCO-RP-ANNOUNCE and cach the announced mappings. If there are conflicts
between two different RP's announced mappings, the RP-mapping agent will
resolve them. The following are three rules for conflict resolution:

  1) Co-existence of longer and shorter group prefixes, from different
     RPs. E.g. when RP1 announces 224.2.*.*, and RP2 announces 224.2.2.*,
     both are accepted;

  2) For announcements for identical group prefixes from two different RPs,
     the one from the RP with the higher IP address is accepted;

  3) No duplicates are sent to the CISCO-RP-DISCOVERY address. E.g. if
     an RP announces both 224.2.2.* and 224.2.*.*, the former group-prefix
     is not sent and only 224.2.*.* is sent to the CISCO-RP-DISCOVERY
     address.

The RP-mapping agent periodically sends out RP-mapping packets to
another well-known group address CISCO-RP-DISCOVERY, the "RP mapping
discovery group". The RP-mapping packets are sent with a period
of 60 seconds.

All designated routers (DRs) listen on CISCO-RP-DISCOVERY and obtain
the group-RP mappings for local use. When a group address is covered
by multiple group-prefixes, e.g. 224.2.*.* and 224.2.2.*, the prefix
with the longest match is used.

  For robustness purpose, multiple RP-mapping agents may be configured
inside the same administrative domain. Each RP-mapping agent also
listens to the the RP mapping discovery group CISCO-RP-DISCOVERY, and
suppresses the sending of its own RP-mapping packets if it hears
RP-mapping packets originated from another RP-mapping agent with a
higher IP address.

3.3 Underlying support for CISCO-RP-ANNOUNCE and CISCO-RP-DISCOVERY

 We assume that the underlying multicast routing mechanism has the
capability to forward packets destined to these two well-known groups.
E.g. in a purely sparse mode cloud, all DRs and the RP-mapping agents
are configured with the default RP for the CISCO-RP-DISCOVERY group.
The RP-mapping agents and all RPs are also configured with the default
RP for the CISCO-RP-ANNOUNCE group. Or in a dense mode capable cloud,
the group CISCO-RP-DISCOVERY and CISCO-RP-ANNOUNCE are treated as
dense mode groups.

4. Packet Format

   The RP announcement and RP-mapping messages are coded in UDP
inside UDP messages with the destination port set to PIM-RP-DISC.
The two messages types have identical packet formats, but with different
code values in the header. The following packet format assumes IPv4
addresses.

  V : RP's highest PIM version. The 2-bit field is encoded as:
	    00 : version unknown
	    01 : version 1

	    11 : Dual version 1 and 2

  Unicast IP address of RP[1-n]:  The unicast IP address of hte [1-n]th RP.

  Group count[1-n]: The number of group prefixes this RP[1-n] maps to.

5. Well known addresses and port number

The following class D addresses were assigned by the IANA for the
auto-rp mechanism:

   CISCO-RP-ANNOUNCE	224.0.1.39
   CISCO-RP-DISCOVERY	224.0.1.40

The following UDP port was assigned by the IANA for use by auto-rp:

   PIM-RP-DISC	496

6. Interoperability between Auto-RP v1+ and v1 systems

The difference between v1 and v1+ only shows up when negative
prefixes are configured and advertised.

The version 1 Auto-RP systems will be able to receive and process
positive prefixes in version 1+ Auto-RP messages, and will treat the
negative prefixes as positive prefixes. But joins/prunes/registers due
to such mis-cached RP-mapping entries will be rejected by Auto-RP v1+
systems.

When a domain upgrades from Auto-RP v1 to v1+, the domain will
inadvertently have a mixture of v1 and v1+ systems. It is wise to
verify the RP-mappings when a negative prefix is configured in such a
network. For a negative prefix, a v1 system will use the denied
RP. While a v1+ router will not use the negative RP, and treat
the groups in sparse mode, while all v1+ systems will treate
the same groups in dense mode.

Therefore the v1+ implementation must enforce the following rules:

 1) When looking up the RP-mapping database, only one longest match
    lookup is done on the group. If the entry found is negative,
    the group is deemed in dense mode, even if another RP-mapping entry
    for a different RP has a shorter positive prefix for this group.

 2) If the same group prefix is advertised from two different RPs,
    one positive, one negative, the RP-mapping agent will always
    cache the negative prefix.

One deny entry in the RP-mapping entry will turn the group-prefix
into dense mode in the entire domain.
   

7. Compatibility issues with alternative RP discovery/advertisement methods

The auto-rp mechanism will be able to co-exist with statically configured
RP mappings, as well as with other RP discovery mechanisms. When other RP
discovery mechanisms come in existence, the group-RP mappings obtained
from different methods can be assigned different preference values.
E.g. the group-RP mappings learned through Auto-RP can take precedence
over the local statically configured group-RP mappings. It is a local
decision and an implementation issue how this preference is established.

The PIM-SM bootstrap mechanism specified in RFC2362 will not be able
to convey negative prefixes. This may be changed in a future PIM
specification.

8. Which RP should be used for CISCO-RP-ANNOUNCE/CISCO-RP-DISCOVERY ?

   This question is irrelavant if these two well-known groups are supported
   by a dense-mode delivery mechanism (as is possible in PIMv2).

   When these two groups are delivered in sparse-mode, they need an RP
   that is agreed on by all the RPs, DRs and the rp-mapping agent.
   Since an RP may announce a dynamic group-RP mapping that covers the
   two well-known groups used by Auto-RP, we need to avoid circular
   dependancies. For these two well-known groups, the staticly
   configured group-RP mapping should override the dynamicly learned RP.
